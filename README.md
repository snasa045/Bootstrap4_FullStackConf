#Full Stack Conf

Full Stack Conf is a dummy conference website. Made this website to practice and show some BootStrap 4 skills to employers. 

Although, we can make this website a fully functional with JSON, AJAX and MEAN stack.

Full Stack Conf is a prototype website and we can reference it to make any real world website.

Thank You!!!
