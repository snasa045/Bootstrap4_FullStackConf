# Full Stack Conf

[Full Stack Conf](https://snasa045.github.io/Bootstrap4_FullStackConf/) is a dummy conference website. Made this website to practice and show some BootStrap 4 skills to employers.

Although, we can make this website a fully functional with JSON, AJAX, and MEAN Stack.

[Full Stack Conf](https://snasa045.github.io/Bootstrap4_FullStackConf/) is a prototype website and we can reference it to make any real world website.

Thank you!!!
